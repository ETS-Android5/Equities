# Equities
Equities is a stock/crypto android application that uses web scraping techniques with JSOUP library, Volley and YoutubeAPI's for video viewing.
It pulls stock/crypto prices, news and othe information from related websites.

The application was previously on google playstore and the amazon appstore but I removed it because I no longer had the time to maintain it.
You can improve it by using API's instead of web scraping or improve the web scraping code.
